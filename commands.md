The client class should have a way to present the information inside its memory better:
1. Get all slots for a given time
2. Show which days are there available slots

The client class should have a way to extract a lot of information from the API:
1. All instances, when information is being written inside the memory, should be separated into functions
2. Higher-order functions should be able to extract open slots for a number of groups for a given time
